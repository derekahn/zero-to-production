# Chapter 2

Building an **Email Newsletter** to simulate a real world project on a team of 5.

## User Stories ðŸ““

> What should our Newsletter do?

A user story helps us to capture who we are building for (`as a`), the actions they want to perform (`want to`) as well as their motives (`so that`).

**First Story**

- `As a` blog visitor:
- `I want to` subscribe to the newsletter,
- `So that` I can receive email updates when new content is published on the blog

**Second Story**

- `As a` blog author:
- `I want to` send an email to all my subscribers,
- `So that` I can notify them when new content is published

## Scope ðŸ”¬:

| In Scope   | Out of Scope                 |
| ---------- | ---------------------------- |
| subscribe  | unsubscribe                  |
| newsletter | multiple newsletters         |
|            | segment/organize subscribers |
|            | tracking analytics           |

- `Subscribe` = Users can subscribe to a "newsletter"
- `Newsletter` = a single email sent to all "subscribers"
