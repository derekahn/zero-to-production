# Chapter 1

Installing Tools ðŸ› 

These notes are specific and targeted for macOS

## First Time?

Need to install rustup

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

## Faster linker

Supposed to cut down on compile times.

Brew install then set with `.cargo/config.toml`

### Install:

```sh
brew install michaeleisel/zld/zld
```

### Usage:

`.cargo/config.toml`

````toml
# On Windows
# ```
# cargo install -f cargo-binutils
# rustup component add llvm-tools-preview
# ```
[target.x86_64-pc-windows-msvc]
rustflags = ["-C", "link-arg=-fuse-ld=lld"]

[target.x86_64-pc-windows-gnu]
rustflags = ["-C", "link-arg=-fuse-ld=lld"]

# On Linux:
# - Ubuntu, `sudo apt-get install lld clang`
# - Arch, `sudo pacman -S lld clang`
[target.x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu]
rustflags = ["-C", "linker=clang", "-C", "link-arg=-fuse-ld=lld"]

# On MacOS, `brew install michaeleisel/zld/zld`
[target.x86_64-apple-darwin]
rustflags = ["-C", "link-arg=-fuse-ld=/usr/local/bin/zld"]

[target.aarch64-apple-darwin]
rustflags = ["-C", "link-arg=-fuse-ld=/usr/local/bin/zld"]
````

## Cargo Watch

Cargo Watch watches over your project's source for changes, and runs Cargo commands when they occur.

> ðŸ’­ Kind of like `nodemon`

### Install:

```sh
# had to install binstall because other way wasn't working
cargo install cargo-binstall

cargo binstall cargo-watch
```

### Usage:

```
# on file change
cargo watch -x check

# on file change: check, test, run
cargo watch -x check -x test -x run
```

## Code Coverage

Tarpaulin is a code coverage reporting tool for the Cargo build system, named for a waterproof cloth used to cover cargo on a ship.

Currently, tarpaulin provides working line coverage and while fairly reliable may still contain minor inaccuracies in the results.

### Install:

```sh
cargo install cargo-tarpaulin
```

### Usage:

```sh
cargo tarpaulin --ignore-tests
```

## Linter

[Clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy) is the official linter maintained by the rust team

### Install:

```sh
rustup component add clippy
```

### Usage:

```sh
cargo clippy

# for CI
cargo clippy -- -D warnings
```
