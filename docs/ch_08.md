# Chapter 8 - Error Handling

- How do errors fit within the broader architecture of our application?
- What does a good _error_ look like?
- Who are errors for?
- Should we use a library?
  - Which one?

## Internal Errors

- The function caller most likely wants to be informed **if** a failure occurs
  - So it can _react accordingly_ i.e.: retry or propagate the failure upstream with `?`
- Rust leverages the type system to communicate whether an operation succeeded or failed via:

```rust
pub enum Result<Success, Error> {
  Ok(Success),
  Err(Error)
}
```

> ðŸ‘† The caller is then forced by the compiler to express how they plan to handle both scenarios: _success_ ad _failure_

If the goal was **only** to communicate to the caller that an error occurred:

```rust
pub enum ResultSignal<Success> {
  Ok(Success),
  Err
}
```

Errors serve two main purposes:

- Control flow (i.e. determine what to do next)
- Reporting (e.g. investigate, after the fact, what went wrong)

Distinguishing errors based on their location:

- Internal (i.e. function calling another function within our application)
- At the edge (i.e. an API request that we failed to fulfill)

Control flow is scripted:

- All information required to take a decision on what to do next must be accessible to a **machine**
- We use types (e.g. enum variants), methods and fields for internal errors.
- We rely on status codes for errors at the edge.
- Error reports are primarily consumed by **humans**.

| ----------------- | **Internal**           | **At the edge** |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- | --------------- |
| **Control Flow**  | Types, methods, fields | Status codes    |
| **Reporting**     | Logs/traces            | Response body   |

- Keep in mind that the line between a _user_ and an _operator_ can be blurry
  - e.g. a user might have access to the source code or they might be running the software on their own hardware

> `actix_web::Error` is used to carry errors from std::error through `actix_web` in a convenient way.

- `actix_web::Error` can be created by converting errors with into().

Rust orphan rule:

> it is forbidden to implement a foreign trait for a foreign type (where foreign stands for "from another crate")

- This restriction is meant to preserve coherence

## Trait Objects

- `dyn Error` a trait object that implements the `Error` trait
- Trait Objects like generic type parameters are a way to achieve polymorphism in Rust
  - i.e. invoke different implementations of the same interface
- Generic types are resolved at compile-time (static dispatch) whereas trait objects incurs a runtime cost (dynamic dispatch)

> The Error trait provides a `downcast_ref` which can be used to obtain a concrete type back from `dyn Error`,
> assuming you know what type to downcast to. There are legitimate use cases for down-casting,
> **but if you find yourself reaching for it too often** it might be a sign that something is not quite right in your design/error handling strategy.
