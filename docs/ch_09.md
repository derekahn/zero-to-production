# Chapter 9 - Naive Newsletter Delivery

- [ ] Authentication
- [ ] Authorization

Amending the user story:

- `As a` blog author,
- `I want to` send an email to all my confirmed subscribers,
- `So that` I can notify them when new content is published.

## Scoped Mocks

To prevent **mocks** from stepping on each other's toes use a **scoped mock**

e.g.

```rs
// ../tests/api/newsletter.rs

let _mock_guard = Mock::given(path("/email"))
  .and(method("POST"))
  .respond_with(ResponseTemplate::new(200))
  .named("Create unconfirmed subscriber")
  .expect(1)
  .mount_as_scoped(&app.email_server) <--------- ðŸ‘€
  .await;
```

- `mount()` the behaviour we specify remains active as long as the underlying `MockServer{}` is up and running
- `mount_as_scoped()` instead returns a guard object; `MockGuard`

- `MockGuard` has a custom `Drop` implementation
  - When it goes out of scope, `wiremock` instructs the underlying `MockServer`to stop honouring the specified behaviour
  - Basically, we stop returning `200 POST /email` at the end of `create_unconfirmed_subscriber`
- The mock behaviour needed for our test helper **stays local** to the test helper itself
- When a `MockGuard` is dropped - we **eagerly** check that expectations on the scoped mock are verified.

## Implementation Strategy

Approach:

- Retrieve the newsletter issue details from the body of the incoming API call
- Fetch the list of all confirmed subscribers from the database
- Iterate through the whole list:
  - Get the subscriber email
  - Send an email out via Postmark
