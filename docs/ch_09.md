# Chapter 9 - Naive Newsletter Delivery

- [ ] Authentication
- [ ] Authorization

Amending the user story:

- `As a` blog author,
- `I want to` send an email to all my confirmed subscribers,
- `So that` I can notify them when new content is published.

## Scoped Mocks

To prevent **mocks** from stepping on each other's toes use a **scoped mock**

e.g.

```rs
// ../tests/api/newsletter.rs

let _mock_guard = Mock::given(path("/email"))
  .and(method("POST"))
  .respond_with(ResponseTemplate::new(200))
  .named("Create unconfirmed subscriber")
  .expect(1)
  .mount_as_scoped(&app.email_server) <--------- ðŸ‘€
  .await;
```

- `mount()` the behaviour we specify remains active as long as the underlying `MockServer{}` is up and running
- `mount_as_scoped()` instead returns a guard object; `MockGuard`

- `MockGuard` has a custom `Drop` implementation
  - When it goes out of scope, `wiremock` instructs the underlying `MockServer`to stop honouring the specified behaviour
  - Basically, we stop returning `200 POST /email` at the end of `create_unconfirmed_subscriber`
- The mock behaviour needed for our test helper **stays local** to the test helper itself
- When a `MockGuard` is dropped - we **eagerly** check that expectations on the scoped mock are verified.

## Implementation Strategy

Approach:

- Retrieve the newsletter issue details from the body of the incoming API call
- Fetch the list of all confirmed subscribers from the database
- Iterate through the whole list:
  - Get the subscriber email
  - Send an email out via Postmark

## Fetch Confirmed Subscribers List

`sqlx::query_as!()` maps the retrieved rows to the type specified as its first argument, saving a lot of boilerplate.

e.g.

```rust
struct ConfirmedSubscriber {
  email: String,
}

async fn get_confirmed_subscribers(
  pool: &PgPool,
) -> Result<Vec<ConfirmedSubscriber>, anyhow::Error> {
  let rows = sqlx::query_as!( <------------ ðŸ‘€
    ConfirmedSubscriber,
    r#"
    SELECT email
    FROM subscriptions
    WHERE status = 'confirmed'
    "#,
  )
  .fetch_all(pool)
  .await?;

  Ok(rows)
}
```

- Notice that `ConfirmedSubscriber` has a single field `email`
- We are minimizing the amount of data we are fetching from the database
- Limits the query to the columns we actually need
- Less work for the database
- Less data to move over the network

## `context` vs `with_context`

- The key difference between the two: `with_context` is **lazy**
  - It takes a closure argument and the closure is only called in case of an error
- If the _context_ you are adding is _static_ - e.g. `context("Oh no!")`; they are equivalent
- If the context you are adding has a **runtime cost**, use `with_context` to avoid paying for the error path when the fallible operation succeeds

```rust
email_client
  .send_email(
    &subscriber.email,
    &body.title,
    &body.content.html,
    &body.content.text,
  )
  .await
  .with_context(|| format!("Failed to send newsletter issue to {}", subscriber.email))?;
```

- Here using `format!` we're allocating memory on the heap to store the output string
- If we used `context` we would be allocating that string every time we send an email out
- Using `with_context` we only invoke `format!` if the `.send_email` fails
