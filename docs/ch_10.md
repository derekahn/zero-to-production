# Chapter 10 - Securing Our API

Problem:

Anyone can hit the API and broadcast whatever they want to our entire mailing list.

- base64-encoding ensures that all the characters in the output are ASCII, but it doesn't provide any kind of protection
  - decoding requires no secrets; It's not encrypted!

## Using A Cryptographic Hash

tldr; Hash all stored passwords!

> Assuming that the input space is finite (i.e. password length is capped),

> f(x) == f(y) implies x == y.

## Preimage Attack

tldr; SHA3-256 is pretty safe.

- To brute-force it, it's a `2^n` where n is the hash length in bits.
- Typically if `n > 128`, it's considered unfeasible to compute unless a vulnerability is found in SHA3
