# Chapter 3

Implementing the first `User Story`:

- `As a` blog visitor:
- `I want to` subscribe to the newsletter,
- `So that` I can receive email updates when new content is published on the blog.

## High level Details ðŸ”–:

- Blog visitors will input email in a form on a web page
- The form performs a `POST` request to `/subscriptions`
- The server will store the email and respond to request

## TODOs âœ…:

- [ ] Implement a `GET /health_checkpoint`
- [ ] Find and vet a web framework
- [ ] Define a testing strategy
- [ ] Find and vet a database driver
- [ ] Define a strategy for database changes (a.k.a migrations)
- [ ] Actually write some queries

## Web Framework Choice

> [Actix Web](https://actix.rs/) is a powerful, pragmatic, and extremely fast web framework for Rust

We will use actix-web because:

- it's one of Rust's oldest frameworks
- seen a lot of production usage
- it runs on tokio which will prevent other async library incompatibilites

> [Tokio](https://tokio.rs/) is an asynchronous runtime for the Rust programming language. It provides the building blocks needed for writing network applications. It gives the flexibility to target a wide range of systems, from large servers with dozens of cores to small embedded devices.
