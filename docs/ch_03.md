# Chapter 3

Implementing the first `User Story`:

- `As a` blog visitor:
- `I want to` subscribe to the newsletter,
- `So that` I can receive email updates when new content is published on the blog.

## High level Details ðŸ”–:

- Blog visitors will input email in a form on a web page
- The form performs a `POST` request to `/subscriptions`
- The server will store the email and respond to request

## TODOs âœ…:

- [ ] Implement a `GET /health_checkpoint`
- [ ] Find and vet a web framework
- [ ] Define a testing strategy
- [ ] Find and vet a database driver
- [ ] Define a strategy for database changes (a.k.a migrations)
- [ ] Actually write some queries

## Web Framework Choice

> [Actix Web](https://actix.rs/) is a powerful, pragmatic, and extremely fast web framework for Rust

We will use actix-web because:

- it's one of Rust's oldest frameworks
- seen a lot of production usage
- it runs on tokio which will prevent other async library incompatibilites

> [Tokio](https://tokio.rs/) is an asynchronous runtime for the Rust programming language. It provides the building blocks needed for writing network applications. It gives the flexibility to target a wide range of systems, from large servers with dozens of cores to small embedded devices.

## Implementing `GET /health_checkpoint`

Add ðŸ“¦s:

```sh
cargo add actix-web@4

cargo add tokio@1
```

Enable features in `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
actix-web = "4"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["macros", "rt-multi-thread"] }
```

Wire up the server in `src/main.rs`:

```rust
use actix_web::{web, App, HttpRequest, HttpServer, Responder};

async fn greet(req: HttpRequest) -> impl Responder {
    let name = req.match_info().get("name").unwrap_or("World");
    format!("Hello {}", &name)
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    HttpServer::new(|| {
        App::new()
        .route("/", web::get().to(greet))
        .route("/{name}", web::get().to(greet))
    })
    .bind("127.0.0.1:8000")?
    .run()
    .await
}
```

- `HttpServer` - handles all _transport level_ concerns
- `App` - application logic: routing, middlewares, request handlers, etc
- `.route` - an endpoint with 2 parameters: `path` and `route`
- `async fn greet()` - is an asynchronous handler
- `Responder` - is a trait, which behavior is anything that can be converted into a `HttpResponse`
- `#[tokio::main]` - changes the _main_ runtime behave asynchronously; it's an **Executor Trait**
  - basically, it's just syntax sugar, the macro actually injects it

Expanded the macro `#[tokio::main]`:

```rust
// =====================================
// Recursive expansion of the main macro
// =====================================

fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    let body = async {
        HttpServer::new(|| {
            App::new()
                .route("/", web::get().to(greet))
                .route("/{name}", web::get().to(greet))
        })
        .bind("127.0.0.1:8000")?
        .run()
        .await
    };
    #[allow(clippy::expect_used, clippy::diverging_sub_expression)]
    {
        return tokio::runtime::Builder::new_multi_thread()
            .enable_all()
            .build()
            .expect("Failed building the Runtime")
            .block_on(body);
    }
}
```
