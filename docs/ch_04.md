> **Observability** is about being able to ask arbitrary questions about your environment without (and this is the key part) having to know ahead of time what you wanted to ask.

## Logging

Logs are the most common type of telemetry data

- The go-to crate for logging in Rust is [log](https://docs.rs/log/latest/log/)
- Any interaction with external systems over the network should be closely monitored
  - networking issues
  - database might be unavailable
  - queries might get slower over time as the `subscribers` table gets longer

## Tracing

`trace`: is the lowest level: trace-level logs are often extremely verbose and have a low signal-to-noise ratio

The lifetime of a span:

- Adding a new subscriber is logged when the span is created
- We enter the span `->`
- We execute the INSERT query
- We exit the span `<-`
  - you can **enter** and **exit** a span multiple times
- We finally close the span `--`
  - closing is final; it happens when the span itself is dropped

To provide all of the incoming HTTP requests with a unique `request_id`,

`tracing-subscriber` provides the key trait [Layer](https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/0.2.12/tracing_subscriber/layer/trait.Layer.html)

- layer makes it possible to build _processing pipelines_ for spans data

- The cornerstone of the layering approach is [Registry](https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/0.2.12/tracing_subscriber/struct.Registry.html)
  - Registry implements the Subscriber trait and takes care of all the difficult stuff
  - The registry is responsible for storing span metadata

When you want to see all logs coming out of a certain test case to debug it you can run:
`TEST_LOG=true cargo test health_check_works | bunyan`

## Secrecy

`#[tracing::intstrument]` requires you to manually **opt-out** of logging function inputs via `skip`.

To redact and protect Personal Identifiable Information (PII) from being exposed in your logs you can use the [secrecy](https://crates.io/crates/secrecy)
