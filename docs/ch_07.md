# Chapter 7 - Reject Invalid Subscribers #2

- [ ] Write a module to send an email
- [ ] Refactor `POST /subscriptions` to handle new business logic
- [ ] Write a `GET /subscriptions/confirm` request handler from scratch

## Subscriber Consent

Checking for user consent to opt-in to the newsletter upfront is not only a great user experience but some countries, like Europe, it's required by [law](https://www.litmus.com/blog/5-things-you-must-know-about-email-consent-under-gdpr/) to get explicit consent.

```
submit form -> server sends confirmation link -> user agrees -> success page
```

When a user subscribes to our newsletter, our request handler will:

- on `POST /subscriptions` we save user data to database; save with a `pending_confirmation` state
- generate a (unique) `subscription_token`
- store `subscription_token` in our database against their id in a `subscriptions_tokens` table
- send an email to the new subscriber containing a link structured as `https://<API-domain>/subscriptions/confirm`
- server returns a `200 OK`

When a user clicks the email confirmation:

- the link will perform a `GET /subscriptions/confirm`
- retrieve `subscription_token` from the query parameters
- retrieve the subscriber id associated with `subscription_token` from the `subscription_tokens` table
- update the subscriber status from `pending_confirmation` to active in the `subscriptions` table
- return a `200 OK`

Possible edge case(s):

- what if user clicks the confirmation link twice

## Connection Pooling

- You need to establish a connection when executing an `HTTP` request against an API hosted on a remote server
- Connecting to a remote server is an expensive operation, even more so if it's `HTTPS`
- Establishing a _brand-new_ connection every time we need to fire off a request can impact the performance of our application
  - might end up leading to a problem known as socket-exhaustion under load
- Connection pooling helps mitigate socket-exhaustion
  - After the first request to the remote server has been completed, it will keep the connection open (briefly) and re-use it if we need it again
- reqwest's `Client` instance initialises a connection pool under the hood
- To leverage this connection pool we need to **reuse the same Client** across multiple requests
- Important to note that `Client::clone` does not create a new connection pool - we just clone a pointer to the underlying pool

How to **reuse** the same `reqwest::Client` in actix-web?

- Create a singleton and store a copy of the pointer in the application context.
- Handlers using an extractor can retrieve the reference

## HTTP Mocking with [wiremock](https://crates.io/crates/wiremock)

- `wiremock::MockServer` is a full-blown HTTP server
- `MockServer::start` asks the operating system for a random available port and spins up the server on a background thread, ready to listen for incoming requests.
- We can retrieve the **address** to our `MockServer` by `MockServer::uri`
- Out of the box (default) `wiremock::MockServer` returns a `404` to all incoming requests
- When `wiremock::MockServer` receives a request, it iterates over all the mounted mocks to check if the request matches their conditions.
- `any()` = "Match all incoming requests, regardless of their method, path, headers or body. You can use it to verify that a request has been fired towards the server, without making any other assertion about it"
  - Basically, it always matches, regardless of the request

## The Intent of A Test Should Be Clear

- Using random data conveys a specific message: do not pay attention to these inputs, their values do not influence the outcome of the test, thatâ€™s why they are random!
- Hard-coded values, instead, should always give you pause:
  - does it matter that `subscriber_email` is set to?
  - Should the test pass if I set it to another value?

## First Sketch Of `EmailClient::send_email`

```sh
curl "https://api.postmarkapp.com/email" \
  -X POST \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Postmark-Server-Token: <TOKEN>" \
  -d '{
  "From": "<SENDER>",
  "To": "<RECEIVER>",
  "Subject": "Postmark test",
  "TextBody": "Hello dear Postmark user.",
  "HtmlBody": "<html><body><strong>Hello</strong> dear Postmark user.</body></html>",
  "MessageStream": "outbound"
}'

{
  "To": "<RECEIVER>",
  "SubmittedAt": "2022-12-18T03:56:11.9538896Z",
  "MessageID": "de45adc4-8924-40dc-a992-85bea0e89239",
  "ErrorCode": 0,
  "Message": "OK"
}
```

- SENDER = the email address you used to sign up
- RECEIVER = must be the same domain as your SENDER email in a **test** account mode
- TOKEN = `08c339c7-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`
