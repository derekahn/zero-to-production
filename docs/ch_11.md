# Chapter 11 - Fault-Tolerant Workflows

> We want our application to be fault-tolerant.

Newsletter delivery should not be disrupted by:

- transient failures; like application crashes
- Postmark API errors or network timeouts.

**Concepts:**

- [ ] idempotency
- [ ] locking
- [ ] queues
- [ ] background jobs

## Idempotency: An Introduction

**retry-safety** is defined as:

> An API endpoint is retry-safe (or **idempotent**) if the caller has no way to **observe**
> if a request has been sent to the server once or multiple times.

**retry-safety** and **idempotency** are often used interchangeably when speaking to various people in the tech world.
